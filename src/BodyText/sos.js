It affects all aspects of your day – from how you feel, to your relationships, productivity, and ultimately, your quality of life. While you sleep, your brain goes to work, consolidating the day’s learning into memory and reenergizing the body. The average individual requires 7-8 hours of sleep per night, but it differs for everyone. Some people may need as much as 10 hours a night, while others need much less. It is a safe bet, however, that if you sleep longer on the weekends than you do during the week, you are not meeting your personal sleep requirement."]

        body: [`You spend more time on your bed than on any other piece of furniture in your home, and you rely on it more for your feelings of comfort and well being. That is why it is so important to find the right mattress for you.

        Consider these questions:
        
        Are you sleeping better or worse than you were one year ago?
        Are you waking up feeling stiff and sore?
        Did you have your best night’s sleep somewhere other than your own bed?
        You can avoid sleepless nights by carefully evaluating the comfort and support of your sleep set twice a year to make sure your personal comfort preferences are met. To get started on selecting a good mattress – one tailored to your individual needs – it helps to become familiar with the basic elements of a comfortable bed.`]
